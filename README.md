# Naughty Bunny Bot
Bot has been made by **Miwca** and **Lat3xKitty**. Art has been provided by **EmiTheGoat**. 

## Description
Developed for the Lovense Easter Dev Jam "Egg Hunt" challenge, Naughty Bunny Bot is a Discord bot that allows users to do a mini server wide egg hunt. The bot will randomly place eggs in the server and users can interact with the egg (via a button). The user with the most eggs at the end of the event wins.

## Setup (Backend)

- [Discord Bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- [Lovense Developer Account](https://www.lovense.com/user/account/profile)

## Setup (Discord side)
